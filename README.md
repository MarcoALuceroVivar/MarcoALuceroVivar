## Hi there 👋 Im Marco!

I am a recent First generation Computer Science graduate with a focus in Cyber Security. I'm passionate about building secure systems and understanding the intersection of human behavior and digital security.

Currently i am working on labs focused on Virutal Networking, automation and IT tooling.

I'm working toward a career in Cyber Security or System Administration roles. My current focus is strengthening my foundation in IT fundamentals, cloud services, automation, and security while continuing to build and refine hands-on projects.
